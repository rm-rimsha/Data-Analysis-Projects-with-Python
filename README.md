# Data_Analysis_with_Python
Completed three projects focusing on data visualization, data analysis, and prediction. Projects include a medical data visualizer, demographic data analyzer, and sea level predictor.

**Demographic Data Analysis**:

  I conducted *EDA*, *Data Cleaning*, and *Data Analysis* that involved answering questions such as: distribution of races in the dataset, average age of men, percentages of people with various education levels, and the relationship between working hours and income, and more.

**Medical Data Visualization**:

  In the Medical Data Visualizer project, I conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (*EDA*) by researching and understanding the meaning of each column and its values. This involved rigorous *data cleaning* to filter out incorrect entries. During data processing, I added a new column to indicate overweight status. For *data analysis*, I utilized data *visualization* techniques to plot categorical data related to cardio diseases (0 or 1) against factors such as activity level, alcohol consumption, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, overweight status, and smoking habits. Additionally, I created a heatmap to visualize correlations between different variables in the dataset, providing valuable insights into the relationships within the data.
